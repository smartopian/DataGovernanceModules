This is a hack location for exploring a Prose Object/CCS (Cascading Content Sheet) approach to https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/governanceGreenPaper/tree/7ef288619fb46e6d9319433c64fbc5bef6250fe7


The goal is to impplement modular data governance agreements in CCS format, and to connect that with standards for documents, ontologies and technologies that implement them.
